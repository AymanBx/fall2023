# When do I get an advantage from git and bash? 

so far we have used git and bash to accomplish familiar goals, and git and bash feel like just extra work for familiar goals. 


Today, we will start to see why git and bash are essential skills: they give you efficiency gains and time traveling super powers (within your work only, sorry)

- [git](https://git-scm.com/docs)
```

## Setup

First, we'll go back to our github inclass folder 

```
cd Documents/inclass/systems/github-inclass-fa23-brownsarahm/
```

and we will make sure we are in sync with GitHub.  We know we *can* fix it, but it is best to not break it. 


```
git status
```

```
On branch fun_fact
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/fun_fact'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

Since our working tree is clean, now we can get updates from GitHub 

```
git pull
```

```
Already up to date.
```

Now let's go back to the main branch. 

```
git checkout main
```

```
Switched to branch 'main'
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.
```

It tells us we are there. 


Let's look at what commits are on the main branch. 

```
git log
```

```

```

We remember that we had added fun facts and none of our commits about those are here, so the fun_fact branch is still ahead of the main branch. 

It's something like this:

This diagram is generated with [mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/gitgraph.html). Since small diagrams are often the best way to express an idea, [GitHub supports mermaid](https://github.blog/2022-02-14-include-diagrams-markdown-files-mermaid/) everywhere it supports markdown (files, comments, issues, etc). You can also draft them live with [mermaid.live](https://mermaid.live/) and from there export them as other styles. 

```

We can merge branches locally, without making a pull request in GitHub.

It is ahead by 3 commits now because there were 3 commits on the fun_fact branch. 

## Organizing a project (workign with files)

A common question is about how to organize projects.  While our main focus
in this class session is the `bash` commands to do it, the _task_ that we are
going to do is to organize a hypothetical python project



next we are going to pretend we worked on the project and made a bunch of files 

```
touch abstract_base_class.py helper_functions.py important_classes.py alternative_classes.py README.md LICENSE.md CONTRIBUTING.md setup.py tests_abc.py test_help.py test_imp.py test_alt.py overview.md API.md _config.yml _toc.yml
```

New bash lessons: 
- `touch` can accept a list of files to create
- a list in bash is space separated with no brackets

```
ls
```

```
API.md			about.md		setup.py
CONTRIBUTING.md		abstract_base_class.py	test_alt.py
LICENSE.md		alternative_classes.py	test_help.py
README.md		helper_functions.py	test_imp.py
_config.yml		important_classes.py	tests_abc.py
_toc.yml		overview.md
```


```
git status
```

```
On branch main
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 3 commits.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	API.md
	CONTRIBUTING.md
	LICENSE.md
	_config.yml
	_toc.yml
	abstract_base_class.py
	alternative_classes.py
	helper_functions.py
	important_classes.py
	overview.md
	setup.py
	test_alt.py
	test_help.py
	test_imp.py
	tests_abc.py

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

## Echo and redirects

`cat` concatenates the contents of a file to stdout, which is a special file that our terminal reads 

```
cat README.md 
```

```

```

`echo` allows us to send a message to stdout.


```
ehco "age=35"
```

```
-bash: ehco: command not found
```


```
echo "age=35"
```

```
age=35
```


We can also **redirect** the contents of a command from stdout to a file in `bash` like file operations while programming there is a similar concept to this mode. 

There are two types of redirects, like there are two ways to write to a file, more generally: 
- overwrite (`>`)
- append (`>>`)

```
echo "age=35" >> README.md 
```


```
cat README.md 
```

```

age=35
```

When we open a file in a program we use functions like
- `fopen` in C
- or `open` in Python

````{margin}
```{note}
**mode** this is a good vocab term that could be added to the site glossary for a community badge
```
````



both require a parameter for the name of the file and 
typically we also have to tell it what *mode* to open the file with, and some options are: 
- read
- write
- append

*C is not an open source language in the typical sense so there is no "official" C docs*

## commit and add has limitations

Now we have made some changes we want, so let's commit our changes.  

Last class we saw we can add and commit at the same time

```
git commit -a -m 'start organizing'
```

```
[main bc28179] start organizing
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
```

This is way fewer thing that we have done recently (remember we also made all of those files with touch)

```
git status

## Experience Report Evidence

## Questions After Today's Class 

• how can the "*" be used consistently to move a bunch of file? because we used it with the text infront of the similarity and behind it. for the .py files we did - "*.yml docs/" and for the test files we did "test_* tests/" so i'm just wondering how it's used for multiple files, because it was used both before the similarity and after the similarity.

• I have some badges from 2 weeks ago that are awaiting a second review after changes had been fixed. Can I merge those (lab 9/8, practice 9/7)

• can you close pull requests on the terminal?

• If you do mv * will it move all files?

• Are there any other ways of using mv that haven't been covered yet?

• how often should we be practicing with the terminal for git?

• Would it be beneficial to organize files with github rather than bash?
