## Experience Report Evidence

## Questions After Today's Class 

• how can the "*" be used consistently to move a bunch of file? because we used it with the text infront of the similarity and behind it. for the .py files we did - "*.yml docs/" and for the test files we did "test_* tests/" so i'm just wondering how it's used for multiple files, because it was used both before the similarity and after the similarity.

• I have some badges from 2 weeks ago that are awaiting a second review after changes had been fixed. Can I merge those (lab 9/8, practice 9/7)

• can you close pull requests on the terminal?

• If you do mv * will it move all files?

• Are there any other ways of using mv that haven't been covered yet?

• how often should we be practicing with the terminal for git?

• Would it be beneficial to organize files with github rather than bash?
