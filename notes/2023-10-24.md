# How can I use bash to automate things?  


## What is bash again? 



So far we have used bash commands to navigate our file system as a way to learn about the file system itself. To do this we used commands like:
- `mv`
- `cd`
- `pwd`
- `ls` 

Bash is a unix shell for the GNU operating system and it has been adopted in other contexts as well.  It is the default shell on Ubuntu linux as well for example (and many others). This is why we teach it. 


We can describe this relationship with a concept map.  Each shape corresponds to a *concept* and the arrows are labeled to describe the relationship between the two concepts.  This can be a helpful way of writing out how you understand things.  




```{mermaid}
flowchart TD
    shell --> |is accessed through| terminal
    bash --> |is instance of| shell
    zsh --> |is instance of| shell
    git --> |is a program accessed though | shell

```

A Unix shell is both a command interpreter and a programming language. As a command interpreter, the shell provides the user interface to the rich set of GNU utilities. The programming language features allow these utilities to be combined. 


Read the official definition of `bash` and a shell in [the bash manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html#Introduction)

We can add this information to the diagram: 

```{mermaid}

    zsh --> |is instance of| shell
    git --> |is a program accessed though | shell
    subgraph shell
        pl[programming language]
        i[command interpreter]
    end

```

## What does this definiton of bash mean?

Today we will start from the main course directory.


Note on macOS when I run `bash` to use the bash shell, it reminds me that MacOS prefers a different shell. 

```{code-block} console
    Last login: Sat Oct 21 17:29:01 on ttys080

The default interactive shell is now zsh.
To update your account to use zsh, please run `chsh -s /bin/zsh`.
For more details, please visit https://support.apple.com/kb/HT208050.
```


We can have different shells in the same terminal in some cases, and all of the different shells on the system have access to the same file system.  



Then I will move to my systems dir
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cd Documents/inclass/systems/
```


and look at files

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls
```

```{code-block} console
fa23-kwl-brownsarahm		github-inclass-fa23-brownsarahm
fall2023			test
ghic				tiny-book
```

## Working from an Example 

```{important}
Here I used `cd fa23-kwl-brownsarahm` and `gh repo view --web` to go to my KWL repo in the browser and then `cd ..` to go back
```

In your KWL repo the `.github/workflows` directory has several `.yml` files that are github action files.  

These files are yaml, with key:value pairs. The values of the `run` key are commands that are passed to bash.  So these are a place where you can see examples of what I did to look for particular syntax.  


Learning from examples is a common strategy in CS and how you can learn new technology especially in a job, so today in class, we modeled that by looking for different syntax in the action files and building up what those things do.  

````{margin}
```{note}
Adding more about github actions here is a good community badge opp. 

Also the note about GNU. 
```
````


## Variables in Bash


We can create variables like `VARNAME=value`. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
NAME='Sarah'
```


notice that there are **no spaces** around the `=`. spaces in bash separate commands and options, so they cannot be in variable declarations.  



A common mistake is to put a space around the `=` sign, this is actually considered **good style** in many other languages. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
NAME ='Sarah'
```

```{code-block} console
-bash: NAME: command not found
```
In bash, however, this creates an error.  When there is a space after `NAME`, `bash` tried to interpet `NAME` as a bash command, but then it does not find it, so it gives an error. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
NAME='Sarah'
```


We can use variables  with a `$` before the variable name. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
echo $NAME
```

```{code-block} console
Sarah
```

```{important}

This variable is local, in memory, to the current terminal window, so if we open a separate window and try `echo $NAME` it will not work. We can also see that it does not create any file changes. 
```

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
echo $NAME
```

```{code-block} console
Sarah
```

We can see that it does not create any files by comparing ls now to what it was before: 
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls
```

```{code-block} console
fa23-kwl-brownsarahm		github-inclass-fa23-brownsarahm
fall2023			test
ghic				tiny-book
```


```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls -a
```

```{code-block} console
.				ghic
..				github-inclass-fa23-brownsarahm
fa23-kwl-brownsarahm		test
fall2023			tiny-book
```

We can, however use the variable at different working directories. So if we move

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cd github-inclass-fa23-brownsarahm/
```

and `echo` agian


```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
echo $NAME
```

```{code-block} console
Sarah
```
it still works!


The `$` is essential syntax for recalling variables in bash. If we forget it, it treats it as a literal
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
echo NAME
```

```{code-block} console
NAME
```

so we get the variable **name** out instead of the variable **value**

We'll go back up a level now: 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cd ..
```
<!-- 
```{code-block} console
``` 
-->


## Bash Loops

We can also make loops like

```
for loopvar in list
do
# loop body
echo $loopvar
done
```

So for example we can loop over some names
````{margin}
```{important}
If you copy-paste this it will have an error, the `>` will appear if you type this content in as a part of the prompt, butyou cannot copy them. 
```
````

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
for name in Sarah Amoy Marcin 
> do
> echo $name
> done
```

A few important things, to make note of:
- loop variable does not need to be an iterator.  the loop variable here `name` takes each value from a list (`Sarah Amoy Marcin`)
- lists is bash are defined with no brackets and no commas `Sarah Amoy Marcin` is a list
- we start the loop body with `do` and close it with `done` these are like the `{` and `}` in some langauges. 
- after we start the loop with a line starting with `for` bash continues that "command" by putting `>` at the start of each line until we end the loop with `done` and then it runs. 


And we see it echos each name: 

```{code-block} console
Sarah
Amoy
Marcin
```

Note that the loop variable is not scope limited to the loop.  After the loop it still has the same value of the last time through the loop. 


```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
echo $name
```

```{code-block} console
Marcin
```

When we get the command back with the up arrow key, it puts it all on one line, because it was one command.  The `;` (semicolon) separates the "lines"

We can add another name in 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
for name in Sarah Amoy Marcin Osman; do echo $name; done
```


```{code-block} console
Sarah
Amoy
Marcin
Osman
```
the output is like before, but with one more


```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
echo $name
```

```{code-block} console
Osman
```

and this time `Osman` is the name left in the loop variable later. 


## Nesting commands

There are examples of this in your KWL repo actions.  If we want the output of a command to be in a variable this is how to do it. 


To do this, let's move to a folder with some files in it. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cd github-inclass-fa23-brownsarahm/
```

here we have a number of files in this working directory: 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls
```

```{code-block} console
API.md			abstract_base_class.py	important_classes.py
CONTRIBUTING.md		alternative_classes.py	setup.py
LICENSE.md		docs			tests
README.md		helper_functions.py
```

We can run a command to generate the list by putting it inside `$()` to run that command first.  Think kind of like PEMDAS and the `$` in bash is for variables. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
for FILE in $(ls)
> do
> echo $FILE
> done
```

```{code-block} console
API.md
CONTRIBUTING.md
LICENSE.md
README.md
abstract_base_class.py
alternative_classes.py
docs
helper_functions.py
important_classes.py
setup.py
tests
```
the `$()` tells bash to run that command first and then hold its output as a variable for use elsewhere

For example, in your `getassignment.yml` I have a line like this: 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
pretitle="prepare-"$(sysgetbadgedate --prepare)
```

it creates a variable that is "prepare-" concatenated with the output of `sysgetbadgedate --prepare`

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
echo $pretitle 
```

```{code-block} console
prepare-2023-10-26
```

We can also modify our previous loop with an option: 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
for FILE in $(ls -a); do echo $FILE; done
```

```{code-block} console
.
..
.git
.github
API.md
CONTRIBUTING.md
LICENSE.md
README.md
abstract_base_class.py
alternative_classes.py
docs
helper_functions.py
important_classes.py
setup.py
tests
```


## Conditionals in bash

We can also do conditional statements
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
if test -f docs 
> then
> echo "file"
> fi
```
the key parts of this: 
- `test` checks if a file or directory exists
- the `-f` option makes it check if the item is a *file*
- what to do if the condition is met goes after a `then` keyword
- the `fi` (backwards`if`) closes the if statment
- the `>` work again like the loop and the `\` we did in the past


this if does nothing though, because `docs` is a directory not a file. 


If we switch it, we get output: 
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
if test -f API.md ; then echo "file"; fi
```

```{code-block} console
file
```

## Script files 

We can put our script into a file 
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
nano filecheck.sh
```

and check the content of the file

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cat filecheck.sh 
```

```{code-block} console
for file in $(ls)
do
	if test -f $file
	then
		echo $file
	fi
done
```

and run it with `bash <filename>`

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
bash filecheck.sh 
```

```{code-block} console
API.md
CONTRIBUTING.md
LICENSE.md
README.md
abstract_base_class.py
alternative_classes.py
filecheck.sh
helper_functions.py
important_classes.py
setup.py
```


```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls
```

```{code-block} console
API.md			abstract_base_class.py	helper_functions.py
CONTRIBUTING.md		alternative_classes.py	important_classes.py
LICENSE.md		docs			setup.py
README.md		filecheck.sh		tests
