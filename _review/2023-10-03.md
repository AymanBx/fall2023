1. Read about different workflows in git and describe which one you prefer to work with and why in {index}`favorite_git_workflow.md` in your kwl repo. Two good places to read from are [Git Book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Distributed-Git-Distributed-Workflows#ch05-distributed-git) and the [atlassian Docs](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows)
2. Update your kwl chart with what you have learned or new questions in the want to know column
3. Create {index}`gitindex.md` and explain the git staging area using an analogy to a hobby or interest of yours.
