badge steps marked **lab** are steps that you will be encouraged to use lab time to work on. 

1. Update your KWL chart with the new items and any learned items.
2. Clone the course website. Append the commands used and the contents of your `fall2023/.git/config`to a {index}`terminal_review.md` (hint: history outputs recent commands and redirects can work with any command, not only echo). Edit the README.md, commit, and try to push the changes. What happens and what GitHub concept that we have not used yet might fix it? see your `vocab-` repo for a list of key github concepts. (answer in the `terminal_review.md`) 
3. **lab** Organize the provided messy folder in a Codepsace (details will be provided in lab time). Commit and push the changes. Answer the questions below in your kwl repo in a file called `terminal_organization.md`
4. clone your `messy_repo` locally and append the `history.md` file to your `terminal_organization.md`
5. Find your team's repository. It will have a name like `fa23-team#` where `#` is a number 1-4. Join the discussion on that repo about naming your team. Link to your comment directly in your PR for this badge (use the 3 dots menu to get the comment specific URL).
