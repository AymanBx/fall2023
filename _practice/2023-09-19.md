1. Create a merge conflict in your github in class repo and resolve it using your favorite IDE, then create one and resolve it on GitHub in browser(this requires the merge conflict to occur on a PR). Describe how you created it, show the files, and describe how your IDE helps or does not help in {index}`ide_merge_conflict.md`. Give advice for when you think someone should resolve a merge conflict in GitHub vs using an IDE. (if you do not regulary use an, IDE, try VSCode)
2.  Learn about [GitHub forks](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks) and more about [git branches](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branches-in-a-Nutshell)(you can also use other resources)
3. add `branches-forks.md` to your KWL repo and describe how branches work, what a fork is, and how they relate to one another. If you use other resources, include them in your file as markdown links.
